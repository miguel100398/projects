slow mode -> The system can be configured at any time and the changes will be reflected inmediately.
	     The system will sense the temperature every 100ms.
	     The system will send Status every 5s

normal mode ->The system can be configured at any time and the changes will be reflected inmediately.
	      The system will sense the temperature every 100ms.
	      The system will send Status every 0.5s

The System Can be executed with the GUI included or with a terminal emulator like Tera Term

*****************************************TERMINAL EMULATOR*************************************************************
To execute the system with a terminal emulator open the terminal and press any key, if you press the "s" key the system
will start in "slow mode", otherwise it will start in "normal mode"
the System will be sending status to the serial port every 0.5s or 5s depending on the mode of operation

The status message will be like the next message
-S- Temp: 26 C, MaxTempTh: 50 C, MinTempTh: 20 C, MaxTemp: off, MinTemp: off, ledIntensity: 0% t:0:0:12:907

S -> Indicates that it is a Status message
Temp: -> Indicates the temperature sensed by the temperature sensor in °C
MaxTempTh: -> Indicates the Maximum Threshold.
MinTempTh: -> Indicates the Minimum Threshold.
MaxTemp: -> Indicates if the temperature is greater than the Maximum Threshold
MinTemp: -> Indicates if the temperature is lower than the Minimum Threshold
ledIntensity: -> Indicates the Intensity of the LED
t: -> Indicates the system time, this time starts running when the system is powered

The system can also send Error Messages <-E->, Info Messages <-I-> and Configuration Messages <-C->

****INFO MESSAGE******
-I-: LedIntensity is at minimun t:0:0:8:169

The Info Message is sent when an action is performed and the parameters of the system were changed

****CONFIGURATION MESSAGE*******
-C- (Press esc key to exit) Set min Temperature Threshold (C):

The Configuration Message is sent when a config Key is pressed and the system is waiting for the data to configure the system

*****ERROR MESSAGE*************

-E-: ERROR_ID: 0x2 Invalid data was sent. Please send a valid temperature (integer numbers) t:0:0:10:420

The Error message is sent when an unexpected behavior or invalid data was sent to the system, the Error message contains the ID of the message
and a brief explanation of the error

To Configure the system you can use the configuration keys, if you pressed another key nothing will be performed

*****CONFIGURATION KEYS***********

"H" or "h" -> displays the system´s help menu
"L" -> Increments 10% the LED´s Intensity
"l" -> Decrements 10% the LED´s Intensity
"N" -> Increments 1°C the maximum Threshold
"n" -> Decrements 1°C the maximum Threshold
"B" -> Increments 1°C the minimum Threshold
"b" -> Decrements 1°C the minimum Threshold
"M" -> Configures manually the maximum Threshold
"m" -> Configures manually the minimum Threshold
"I" or "i" -> Configures manually the LED´s Intensity

*****************************************GUI******************************************************************************
To Use the GUI execute the file SmartHouse.Jar, a window will be prompt to select the SerialPort, if no port is selected,
the port is bussy or the system can´t oppen the port the GUI will be closed
After the port is selected the system will be automatically started in "slow mode" this is neccesary because off the slowness of the serial
reading

The GUI´s left panel is the information panel, this panel displays the system´s information, this panel is updated every 5s

The GUI´s right panel is the configuration panel, in this panel you can configure the system´s parameters, the changes are reflected 
inmediately in the system but they could have a delay of 5s to be reflected in the information panel or to display the error windows

If invalid data is sent the GUI can display an error window, this window doesn´t stop the system, the system is still working but the 
configuration wasn´t set to the system
The system can also prompt error windows, if the system sends an error message the GUI will prompt an error window.

To configure manually the maximum Threshold use the button "Set maximum Threshold" after filling the field next to the button with 
the data to be sent to the system.

To configure manually the minimum Threshold use the button "Set minimum Threshold" after filling the field next to the button with 
the data to be sent to the system.

To configure manually the LED´s intensity use the button "Set LED intensity" after filling the field next to the button with 
the data to be sent to the system.

The button "max TH +1°C" will increment in 1°C the maximum Threshold
The button "max TH -1°C" will decrement in 1°C the maximum Threshold
The button "min TH +1°C" will increment in 1°C the minimum Threshold
The button "min TH -1°C" will decrement in 1°C the minimum Threshold

Use the button "Open Help" to oppen this help file

The label "upper temperature threshold" indicates the status of the threshold, if it is green the temperature is greater than the maximum 
threshold, if it is red the temperature is lower than the maximum threshold

The label "lower temperature threshold" indicates the status of the threshold, if it is green the temperature is lower than the minimum 
threshold, if it is red the temperature is greater than the minimum threshold

The gui writes a log in "log.txt", this log will capture the actions performed by the system and the GUI

the log message will start with and identification code 
-I- -> Information
-S- -> Status
-C- -> Configuration
-E- -> Error

after the identification code will be the source of the message, if the source is "STM32()" indicates that it is a message sent by the system
otherwise is a message sent by a GUI´s componnent

When the GUI is closed the log is also closed and it generates a summary of the messages received

Every time that the GUI is executed the log file is overrided.

The Log can be opened by pressing the button "Open Log"
